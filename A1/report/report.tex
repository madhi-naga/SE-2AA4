\section{Testing of the Original Program}
	
	My approach to testing my program was to utilize "assert" with unittest to provide whether there were any failures or not. When testing the move and distance function, I used \url{https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html} as a basis for my test case answers. For the arrival\_date function, I first calculated the distance. I then calculate the number of days, using the distance calculated and speed (in km/days). For the final date result, used \url{https://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html}.
\newline
	When testing my code, I noticed that when testing functions in pos\_adt that returned decimal values, these test cases would fail unless if both numbers were equal. Since this is unreasonable and inconvenient for testing, I used "self.assertAlmostEqual" and utilized a range, in which both values can differ at max between each other.

\section{Results of Testing Partner's Code}

When testing my partner's code, all test cases, but for the "test\_arrival\_date". I noticed that in the arrival\_date of my partner's pos\_adt, she used the ceil() function.

\item 
Pytest offers a more detailed explanation of where a failure occurs for test cases. The test script could use just "assert" rather than
self.assert. While I did not use pytest, I utilized unittest (a demo of pytest) which can be used right out of the box in python. I found unittest also uses the "assert" syntax, however it does not offer an as detailed explanation for failures.

\item 
Some past examples of Software Engineering failures are NASA's Spirit Rover (shutdown because it ran out of flash memory) and the 2003 Northeast Blackout (due to a race condition) ... Software quality and high cost is still a major challenge since
